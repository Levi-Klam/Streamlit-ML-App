# Streamlit-ML-App
This is the code to a project that uses several basic machine learning concepts to test their effectiveness on a dataset. For this project I used credit loan data to guess if an individual would be approved for a loan based on factors like marital status, employment, income, loan amount, and credit history.

To run the program, install the dependencies and run **streamlit run main.py** in the terminal. If this doesn't work, try running it through python using **python -m streamlit run main.py**
